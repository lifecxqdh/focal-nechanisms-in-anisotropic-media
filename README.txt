This repo are based on the general dislocation model and show how the anisotropy and faulting motion affect the focal mechanisms. 
The codes contain the moment tensor decomposition, radiation pattern, radiated energy ratio and seismic record.
 moment tensor decomposition: figure2.m; figure3.m (they have same code but change some   parameters. )
 radiation pattern: figure4.m
 radiated energy ratio: figure6a.m; figure6b.m;figure7a.m;figure7b.m
 seismic record: figure9_1.m; figure9_2.m
 analytical solution: anasolu.m
 calculation of moment tensor based on general dislocation model: computemoment.m
